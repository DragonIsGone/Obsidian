 #### 4.7 Exercise

1. **Explain why a large spherical mass of uranium may be able to sustain a chain reaction, while the same mass spread into a flat sheet could not.**
    as the nuetrons would escape out because 3d space yes
2. **In what form does the released energy from a nuclear fission reaction appear?**
    Heat, lots of it
3. **Why are neutrons good at initiating nuclear reactions?**
    As they are able to split uranium atoms
4. **Describe a chain reaction.**
    When the splitting of uranium produces more neutrons to split more uranium nuclei 
5. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of fusion power as compared to fission power?**
    Advantages is it produces no waste products and is inherently stable as any failure in heating or magnetic containment would immediately terminate the reaction as compared to fission as its a chain reaction is difficult to fully halt

	The disadvantages is the amount of power needed to achive the conditions right for fusion to occur meaning much of the power is used in the generation making it difficult to generate a positive power and achive lawson criterion

MC The neutrons ejected from the fission of uranium-235 are travelling too fast to initiate fission in surrounding uranium-235 nuclei.

This problem is overcome in nuclear fission reactors by using

1. enrichment.
    
2. ==a moderator.==
    
3. control rods.
    
4. chain reactions.

**Explain what a fission chain reaction is.**
Its a chain reaction where split uranium atoms have excess neutrons collide splitting more atoms
