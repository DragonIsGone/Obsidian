## 4.6 Textbook Questions

#### 4.6 Exercise

1. **Define the terms _fusion_ and _fission_.**
    Fusion is the combining of atoms
    Fission is when atoms split apart
2. **Which of these reactions occurs in our Sun?**
    Fusion
3. **Explain why splitting uranium-235 nuclei releases energy, but joining hydrogen atoms also releases energy.**
    The energy from fission is the kinetic energy of the particals emitted
    Fusion energy comes from the fact the total weight of the new atom is not equal to the sum of two inputs
4. **Use the graph of binding energy per nucleon (see [figure 4.19](https://content2.learnon.com.au/title?isbn=9781119887843&subisbn=&topicid=5382&subtopicid=67648#F4.18)) to estimate the amount of energy released when a uranium-235 nucleus is split into barium-141 and krypton-92. Think carefully about the number of significant figures in your answer. How well does your answer agree with the measured value of 200 MeV?**
    
5. **Why is energy released in the process of fusing two small nuclei together?**
    Heat and kinetic energy
6. **What aspect of the graph of binding energy per nucleon shows that fusion of light elements releases more energy than fission of heavy ones?**
	    The binding energy is smaller meaning more energy can be released
7. **When two light elements fuse to form a single heavier one, is the product lighter or heavier than the sum of the masses of the two light atoms? Explain.**
    Lighter, as nuetrons are also ommited when they a fused together
8. **When uranium-236 undergoes fission to form two lighter nuclei plus some neutrons, is the mass of the uranium-236 greater than, equal to or less than the sum of the masses of the two nuclei plus the neutrons? Explain.**
    Equal to (i think) due to conservation of mass

MC The isotope Fe-56 sits at the highest point of the graph of average binding energy per nucleon versus mass number.

What is the implication of this fact?

1. ==Fe-56 is the most stable nucleus.==
    
2. Fe-56 can be split into any pair of other nuclei with the release of energy.
    
3. Fe-56 is the most difficult nucleus to form.
    
4. Fe-56 has the smallest difference between its own mass and the total original mass of its constituents.

MC If two smaller nuclei can be combined to form a larger nucleus, higher on the binding energy curve, then which of the following statements is correct?

1. Energy needs to be supplied, to provide the extra binding energy.
    
2. Mass needs to be supplied, to provide the extra mass.
    
3. Energy would be released, equal to the gain in binding energy.
    
4. ==Energy would be released, equal to the increase in mass of the product nucleus.==
