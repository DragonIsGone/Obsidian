## 4.5 Textbook Questions

#### 4.5 Exercise

1. What does the equation _E_ = _mc_2 express about mass and energy?_
    it expresses that energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared
2. What is the energy equivalent of 100 grams of mass in joules?
    E = MC$^2$ 
    E = 100 x (3 x 10$^8$)$^2$
    E = 9 x 10$^2$ Joules
3. A positron and an electron (each of mass 9.1 × 10$^{−31}$ kg) annihilate each other. How much energy is released?
    E = 2 x 9.1 × 10$^{−31}$ kg x (3 x 10$^8$)$^2$
    E = 
4. What is the energy content of a 4500 kJ meal in eV?
    
5. Calculate the mass equivalent of 4500 kJ.
