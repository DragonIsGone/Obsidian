### Vector vs Scalar
- A Vector is a physical quanitiy that has both magnitude and direction
- scalar is a quantity that only has size


| **VECTOR**   | **SCALAR** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Displacement | Distance   |
| Velocity     | Speed      |
| Acceleration | Time       |
| Force        | Charge     |
| Momentum     | Current    |

**Vector**
Vector is V with ~ under

### Displacement vs Distance
- distance is how far you traveled
- Displacement is the displacement ("As the crow flies") 
- $\delta$
