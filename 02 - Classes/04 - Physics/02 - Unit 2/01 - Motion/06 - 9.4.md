    1. **they both reach the ground at the same time**
        As the force of the balls are different aloung with the mass the acceleration ends up being the same at 9.8 m/s

    2. **During which part of the jump is:**
        
        1. **the upwards force on the jumper due to the tension in the bungee cord greater than the force due to gravity on the jumper**
	             
        2. **the force due to gravity on the jumper greater than the upward pull of the bungee cord?**
            
    3. **What tension in the bungee cord is needed for the jumper to travel at a constant speed? Does this occur at any time during the jump? Explain.**
        
5. **A car of mass 1200 kilograms starts from rest on a horizontal road with a forward driving force of 10 000 N. The resistance to motion due to road friction and air resistance totals 2500 N.**

6. **A train of mass 8.0 × 106 kilograms travelling at a speed of 25 m s−1 is required to stop over a maximum distance of 360 metres. What frictional force must act on the train when the brakes are applied if the train is to do this?**
    
7. **A short-sighted skier of mass 70.0 kilograms suddenly realises while travelling at a speed of 12.0 m s−1 that there is a steep cliff 50.0 metres straight ahead. What frictional force is required on the skier if he is to stop just before he skis off the edge of the cliff?**
    
8. **A Physics teacher decides, just for fun, to stand on some bathroom scales (calibrated in newtons) in a lift. The scales provide a measure of the force with which they push up on the teacher. When the lift is stationary, the reading on the bathroom scales is 700 N. What will be the reading on the scales when the lift is:**
    
    1. **moving upwards at a constant speed of 2.0 m s−1**
        
    2. **accelerating downwards at 2.0 m s−2**
        
    3. **accelerating upwards at 2.0 m s−2?**

    2. **What is the magnitude of the ball’s acceleration at the top of its flight?**
