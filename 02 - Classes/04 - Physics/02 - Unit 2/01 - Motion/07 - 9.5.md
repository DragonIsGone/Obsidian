MC A small car has a head-on collision with a very heavy truck.

How do the magnitudes of the forces from the collision on each vehicle compare?

1. There is a larger magnitude force on the small car.
    
2. There is a larger magnitude force on the heavy truck.
    
3. The forces are equal in magnitude.
    
4. There is insufficient information to make a comparison.

Two skaters, P and Q, are standing facing each other on smooth ice. P has twice the mass of Q. They push one another apart and Q moves away with an initial acceleration of magnitude 3.0 m s−2.

Calculate the magnitude of the initial acceleration of P. Show your reasoning.
