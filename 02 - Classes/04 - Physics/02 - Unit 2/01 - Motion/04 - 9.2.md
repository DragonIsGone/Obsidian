**The gravitational field strength ( _g_ ) on planet X is exactly one-half of the value on Earth.**

**A set of bathroom scales on Earth works by first measuring the gravitational force on a person in N. Secondly, this force value is divided by the gravitational field strength of Earth and shown on the dial as a mass in kg.**

**These scales correctly read a person’s mass as 50 kg on Earth. The person takes these scales to planet X and stands on the scales.**
