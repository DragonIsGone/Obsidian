    6. The impulse applied to a netball by a goal shooter as she pushes it up towards the goal at a speed of 5 m s−1
        
    7. The change in momentum of a tennis ball as it is returned to the server in a Wimbledon final
        
3. A 60-gram tennis ball is bounced vertically onto the ground. After reaching the ground with a downwards velocity of 8.0 m s−1, the ball rebounds with a velocity of 6.0 m s−1 vertically upwards.
    
    1. What is the change in momentum of the tennis ball?
        (0.06 x 6) - (0.06 x -8)
        = 0.84 kg m s-1
    2. What is the impulse applied by the tennis ball to the ground? Explain how you obtained your answer without any information about the change in momentum of the ground.
        
    3. Does the ground actually move as a result of the impulse applied by the tennis ball? Explain your answer.
        
    4. If the tennis ball is in contact with the ground for 2.0 × 10−3 s, what is the average net force on the tennis ball during this interval?
        
    5. What is the average normal force during this time interval?
        
4. A 75-kilogram basketballer lands vertically on the court with a speed of 3.2 m s−1.
    
    1. What total impulse is applied to the basketballer's feet by the ground?
        
    2. If the basketballer’s speed changes from 3.2 m s−1 to zero in 0.10 seconds, what total force does the ground apply to his feet?
        
    3. Estimate the height from which the basketballer fell to the court.
        
5. A car with a total mass of 1400 kilograms (including occupants) travelling at 60 km h−1 hits a large tree and stops in 0.080 seconds.
    
    1. What impulse is applied to the car by the tree?
        
    2. What force is exerted by the tree on the car?
        
    3. What is the magnitude of the deceleration of the 70-kilogram driver of the car if he is wearing a properly fitted seatbelt?
        
6. Airbags are fitted to the centre of the steering wheel of many new cars. In the event of a sudden deceleration, the airbag inflates rapidly, providing extra protection for a driver restrained by a seatbelt. Explain how airbags reduce the likelihood of serious injury or death.
    
7. Joggers are advised to run on grass or other soft surfaces rather than concrete paths or bitumen roads to reduce the risk of knee and other leg injuries. Explain why this is so.
    
8. The following graph shows how the horizontal force on the upper body of each of two occupants of a car changes as a result of a head-on collision. One occupant is wearing a seatbelt while the other is not. Both occupants are stationary 0.10 seconds after the initial impact.

    1. What is the horizontal impulse on the occupant wearing the seatbelt?
        
    2. If the mass of the occupant wearing the seatbelt is 60 kilograms, determine the speed of the car just before the initial impact.
        
    3. Is the occupant who is not wearing the seatbelt heavier or lighter than the other (more sensible) occupant?
        
    4. Write a paragraph explaining the difference in shape between the two curves on the graph.
        
9. The following graph shows how the upward push of the court floor changes as a 60-kilogram basketballer jumps vertically upwards to complete a slam dunk.
    
    [![](https://content2.learnon.com.au/secure/ebooks/97811198/9781119887843/images/c09f103.png)](https://content2.learnon.com.au/secure/ebooks/97811198/9781119887843/images/lightwindow/c09f103.png)
    
    1. What is the impulse applied to the basketballer by the floor?
        
    2. With what speed did the basketballer leave the ground?
        
    3. What was the average force exerted on the basketballer by the floor during the 0.10-second interval?
        
    4. Explain why the initial upward push of the floor is not zero.
        
10. A well-known politician makes the suggestion that if cars were completely surrounded by rubber ‘bumpers’ like those on dodgem cars, they would simply bounce off each other in a collision and passengers would be safer. Discuss the merits of this suggestion in terms of Newton’s laws of motion.
