### Momentum and impulse
- in isolated collision two object exert a force on each other
- **Momentum = Mass x Velocity**
- **Impulse = Force x Delta Time = Delta Momentum** 

- Force x delta time = impulse = delta momentum 
- in isolated collision forces are equal and opposite between two collisions
- Delta momentum of B = - Delta momentum of A

- Sum of initial momentum = Sum of final momentum

- M<sub>1</sub> x U<sub>1</sub> + M<sub>2</sub> x U<sub>1</sub> +
