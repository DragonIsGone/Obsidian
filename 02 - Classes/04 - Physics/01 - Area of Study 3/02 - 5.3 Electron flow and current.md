## Electrical Current
- Electrical current is movment of charged particals
- electrons move from the negetive terminal as the electrons heavy particals are negetivly charged
### Current key
Current: *I = Q/T*
*I* = Current
*Q* = Charge (C)
*T* = Time

### Ammeter
- measures current in circuit
- must be placed in the circuit
![[Ammeter diagram 1.png]]

### EMF
- a measure fof the enrgy supplied to a circut
- Unit is in volts
- signed by "ε"

### 5.3 Questions
1. **State the difference between conventional current and electron current**
- Electron flow moves form the negative terminal (charge of electrons) to the positive terminal on a battery while conventional current has electrons moving from the charged positive end to the negative end of the battery
2. **What is the difference between direct current and alternating current?**
- Direct current is when the current moves in one direct motion around a circuit while alternating current is a property of modern power generation where current will flow both in a conventional current and an electron current based on the phase.
1. **A steady direct current of 2.5 A ﬂows in a wire connected to a battery for 15 seconds. How much charge enters or leaves the battery in this time?**
- Q = I x T
  Q= 37.5
2. **Convert 45 mA to amperes.**
45 / 1000 =
0.045 amperes
3. **Convert 2.3 × 10−4 A to milliamperes.**
 0.00023 A
 = 0.23mA
4. **Is current used up in a light globe? Explain your answer.**
Current is used in a light globe as the current takes the electrons from the wall to the globe where the electrons convert electrical energy to heat and light before being transported by the current back
5. **A car light globe has a current of 3.5 A ﬂowing through it. How much charge passes through it in 20 minutes?**
Q = I x T 
Q = 3.5 x 20
Q = 70c
