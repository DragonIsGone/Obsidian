4. Explain how a potentiometer can be used to dim the lights in a bedroom.
    As the dial is turned the potentiometer which is a variable resistor has its resistance increased which restricts power flowing to the light bulbs
5. One light-emitting diode (LED) used in a set of traffic lights has a switch-on voltage of 0.6 V and experiences a current of 2.4 mA. The set of traffic lights contains 40 LEDs in each of the red, amber and green sections. Before LEDs were used, a set of traffic lights used three 200-W light bulbs.
    
    1. Calculate the power emitted by one LED in the traffic light.
	    P = VI

The voltage divider circuit shown has an unknown resistor, _R_, in series with a light dependent resistor (LDR). The LDR has the characteristic curve shown in the graph. The output voltage across the LDR is used to operate a switch.

[![](https://content2.learnon.com.au/secure/ebooks/97811198/9781119887843/images/c06f61.png)](https://content2.learnon.com.au/secure/ebooks/97811198/9781119887843/images/lightwindow/c06f61.png)

The value of _R_ is initially set so that _V_ out = 8.0 V at a particular light intensity, _L_ 1. (You do not need to know the value of _R_.)

It is then desired that the condition of _V_ out = 8.0 V should occur at a greater light intensity, _L_ 2.

Should _R_ be increased or decreased? Explain your reasoning.
