- Most energy produced from sun
- 3.86 x 10$^{26}$
### Blackbody radiation
- black body will absorb all radiation and felect none
- low temp will radiate little energy
- high temp radiates lots of energy

#### Calculating peak
$$\lambda \space = \space  2.90 \space * \space 10^{-3}$$
#### 1.4 Exercise

1. **When electromagnetic radiation is shone on an object, which three interactions can occur between the radiation and the object?**
    
2. **A Thermos flask, which is designed to minimise heat loss from the liquid it contains, has a shiny and reflective inner and outer surface. Describe how this feature would assist in minimising heat loss.**
    The reflective inner surface would reflect the infared radiation preventing it from escaping
3. **Refer back to figure 1.10 to answer the following questions.**
    
    1. **A star has a surface temperature of 6000 K. What will the colour and wavelength of its peak radiation emission be?**
        
    2. **The star Spica is the 16th brightest star in the sky, and has a surface temperature of around 25 000 K. Extrapolating from the graph, what is the colour of this star likely to be? Justify your response.**
        
4. **All objects with a temperature above absolute zero (–273.15 °C) emit radiant thermal energy. As an object’s temperature is increased, what happens to the _wavelength_ and _frequency_ of the radiation emitted by the surface of the object?**
    
5. **A metal filament is heated as a current passes through it, initially glowing a dull red colour as it begins to heat up. As the current is increased, the red colour of the filament becomes brighter, eventually turning a yellow colour. As the current allows the filament to reach its maximum temperature, it glows a white colour.**

    **With reference to the graph in figure 1.10, explain the reasons for the colour changes in the metal filament as it increases in temperature.**
    
6. **Earth’s surface has an average temperature of 288 K. What is the wavelength of maximum emission from Earth’s surface?**
    
7. **Our Sun gives off most of its light in the ‘yellow’ portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. _λ_ max is 510 nm. Calculate the average surface temperature of the Sun.**
