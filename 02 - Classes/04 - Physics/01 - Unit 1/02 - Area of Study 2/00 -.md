### How many protons and nuetrons
Hydrogen-2: 1 proton, 1 nuetron
Americium-241: 95 Proton, 146 neutons
Uropium-152: 63 protons, 89 neutrons 

When 90 protons and 144 neutrons
**Thorium-234**


### Fundamental forces
- Electrostatic
	- Electronic force between magnets
- Gravitational
	- Objects attracted by mass
- Weak Nuclear
	- Acts on protons, neutrons, electrons and neutinos in order to bring beta decay
- Strong Nuclear
	- attracts/glues the nucleus
