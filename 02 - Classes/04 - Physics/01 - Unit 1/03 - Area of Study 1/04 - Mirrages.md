### Mirrages
- caused by hot air
- hot air above makes light bend away
- causese optical illusion

#### 2.5 Exercise

1. **In which direction would you need to look to see a rainbow early on a rainy morning, and from which direction should the rain be coming from?**
    West because the sun rises in the east and you need the run to be behind you to view a rianbow
2. **MC When looking at a rainbow, what is the order of the colours from top to bottom?**
    
    1. ==Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
        
    2. Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red
        
    3. Blue, indigo, violet, green, red, orange, yellow
        
    4. Red, orange, yellow, blue, green, indigo, violet
        
3. **The spectrum produced by a rainbow and by a prism look similar. Describe the differences between them.**
    
4. **MC A mirage occurs when**
    
    1. the air is hot and the ground is cool.
        
    2. both the air and the ground are very hot.
        
    3. ==the ground is very hot and the air is cool==.
        
    4. the air is slightly cooler than the ground.
        
5. **Explain the optical phenomenon visible on the road through the bush that is shown in the following figure.**

	This is a mirage where light bends ups and ends up reflecting the sky while the brain still percives it as going straight
#### **2.5 Exam questions**

**[](https://content2.learnon.com.au/embedded-searchlight?&isbn=9781119887843&assetid=tlvd-3874)Question 1 (3 marks)**

**Sophie and Emma are looking at a rainbow.**

**Sophie states that they are both seeing the same light from the same water droplets to form the rainbow.**

**Emma states that, while they are seeing the same phenomenon, the rainbow she is seeing is made up of different light from the one Sophie is seeing.**

**Determine who is correct. Justify your answer using theory.**
Emma is correct as the rainbow is a product of total internal relfection of the water droplets would not be in the correct place for both of them at the same time

**Dispersion is the phenomenon that explains the range of colours produced by a rainbow (whereas the natural formation of rainbows and their arc shape relates to total internal reflection).**

**Explain how a rainbow can be formed from a beam of white light.**

**After a storm, Anna walks along the Yarra River in the Royal Botanic Gardens. Looking to the west, she sees a rainbow that has formed over the National Gallery of Victoria.**
