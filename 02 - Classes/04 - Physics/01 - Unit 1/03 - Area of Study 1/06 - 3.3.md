#### 3.3 Exercise

1. **Explain, with the aid of a well-labelled diagram, how heat is transferred through a substance by conduction.**
    The heat when being transfered through via convection it cycles around as the warm air seeks to rise
2. **Why are liquids and gases generally poorer conductors of heat than solids?**
	As they don't have
3. **Explain how convection occurs in water that is being heated in a test tube from below.**
    Convection occurs 
4. **Why is it not possible for heat to be transferred through solids by convection?**
    Because the molecules in the solid are rigid and unable to move around
5. **At what speed does radiant energy move through space? What is significant about this speed?**
    
6. **When you swim in a still body of water on a hot afternoon there is a noticeable temperature difference between the water at the surface and the deeper water.**
    
    1. **Explain why this difference occurs.**
        
    2. **If the water is rough, the difference is less noticeable. Why?**
        
7. **Standing near the concrete wall of a city building after a hot day, you can instantly feel its warmth from a few metres away.**
    
    1. **How is the energy transferred to you?**
        
    2. **What caused the building to get hot during the day?**
        
8. **Why is it not practical to drink hot coffee in an aluminium picnic cup?**
    
9. **Why do ducts in the ceiling need more powerful fans than those in the floor?**

**How is conduction affected by the temperature difference between materials?**
conduction is less effective with insulating materials as they don't allow the transfer of energy ebtween them as easily compared to conductive materials
