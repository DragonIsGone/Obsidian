### Concept
> A wave is a transfer of energy where no transfer of mater

#### Example
- Gravitaional wave
- mechanical wave (slinky)
- light wave
- sound waves
- water waves

**TLDR:**
- Mechanical Waves - require a medium to carry them (sound, rope, waver, etc)
- Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium (light)

### Transverse waves
- **Crest** - Top
- **Troughs** - Bottom

### Mesauring:
- Wavelength - how long a wave is
- Peiriod - time taken to fully cycle
- Amplitude - Distance

#### Wave equation
$$v \space = \space f\lambda \space = \space \frac{\lambda}{T}$$

### Wave model for light
- Electro magnetic wave
- Goes through space without medium
- goes at the speed of light (3 x 10$^8$)

## 1.2 Textbook Questions

#### 1.2 Exercise

1. **How is a periodic wave different from a single pulse moving along a rope?**
    Periodic wave has consistent pulses aloung the wave while
2. **How is a periodic longitudinal wave different from a transverse wave?**
    A longitude wave oselations consists of up and down movement while a transverse wave has waves of compression and refraction
3. **What is the speed of sound in air if it travels a distance of 996 m in 3.00 s?**
    332$ms^-1$
4. **Describe the motion of particles in a medium as a transverse wave passes through the medium.**
    The motion of partials is compaction of them together then being pressed apart
5. **Describe the motion of particles in a medium as a longitudinal wave passes through the medium.**
    The particals move up and down causing the wave to move
