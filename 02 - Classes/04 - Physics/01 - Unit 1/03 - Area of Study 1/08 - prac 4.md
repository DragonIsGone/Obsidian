#### Water
mass = 0.2 kg
Initial Temp = 84 celcius
Final Temp = 70 celcius

C$^{water}$ = 4.18 * 10^3 J kg -1

### Aluminium
Mass = 0.2
Initial Temperature = 19 celcius
Final temp = 70

## Questions
1. **Determine change in temp**
14 *
2. **Calculate the decrease in thermal energy**
$$Q = mc \delta T$$
$$0.2\space * \space 4200 \space * \space 14$$
$$=11760$$
3. **Determin change in temp of aliminium**
70 - 19 = 51
4. **Calculate specific heat capacity**
$$C = \frac{Q}{m\delta T}$$
$$C = \frac{11760}{0.2*51}$$
$$C= 1.15*10^{3}$$
5. **What assumption has to be made for the data**
That no heat is lost during the experiment and is not radiated into the air
6. It is likely
The final calculation is an overestimation of the specific heat capacity due to loss of heat in system and decay of heat between reaching equalibriam and 


## STEAM PRAC
**STARTING MASS** = 1.751 Kg
**FINAL MASS** = 1.663 Kg

Ein = V x I x T
Ein = 2200 x 120
Ein = 264000

Q = mL
mL = (2200 x 120)/0.088
= 3 x 10^6 J/Kg

Acceptable value
2.26 x 10^6
