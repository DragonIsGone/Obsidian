- Ice block melts once it reaches 0 but as energy is dumps but temp remains the same

#### 3.4 Exercise

1. **The quantity of energy needed to increase the temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the mass, specific heat capacity and the change in temperature of the substance. If 200 kJ is used to increase the temperature of a particular quantity of a substance, how much energy would be needed to bring:**
    
    1. **twice as much of the substance through the same change in temperature**
        400 kJ
    2. **three times as much of the substance through a temperature change twice as great?**
        600 kJ
2. **Use table 3.3 to answer the following questions.**
    
    1. **Why is the specific heat capacity of the human body so high?**
        Because most of the human body is largly made up of water which has a very high specific heat capacity
    2. **Why is the specific heat capacity of deserts so much lower than that of fertile topsoil?**
        As there is not much water in deserts so the overall head capacity is low
    3. **When heating water to boiling point in a saucepan, some of the energy transferred from the hotplate is used to increase the temperature of the saucepan. Which would you expect to gain the most energy from the hotplate: an aluminium, copper or steel saucepan of similar size? (_Note:_ Steel is nearly three times denser that aluminium.)**
        Copper would have the largest heat in the saucepan as copper is a high conductor
    4. **Make some general comments about the order of substances listed in table 3.3.**
        
    
4. **The following graph shows the heating curve obtained when 500 g of candle wax in solid form was heated from room temperature in a beaker of boiling water.**

    1. **What is the boiling point of the candle wax?**
        50 *c
    2. **During the interval BC there is no increase in temperature even though heating continued. What was the energy transferred to the candle wax being used for during this interval?**
	    The energy is being transfered into fusion with latent heat  
    3. **In which state of matter was the candle wax during the interval CD?**
        The candle wax was in a liquid state
    4. **Which is higher: the specific heat capacity of solid candle wax or the specific heat capacity of liquid candle wax? Explain your answer.**
        The specific heat of the liquid candle wax is lower than the specific heat capacity of solid wax, this is shown through the gradiance of temperature in the two states 
    5. **Explain, in terms of the kinetic particle model, what is happening during the interval DE.**
        In the interval D to E the particals transition from a liquid state to a gas state, this is shown on the partical scale by the wax particals gaining enough speed that they can break free from the bonds of the 
5. **How much ice at 0 °C could be melted with 1 kilogram of steam at 100 °C, assuming no loss of energy to the surroundings? Use the specific latent heat values quoted in [table 3.4](https://content2.learnon.com.au/title?isbn=9781119887843&subisbn=&topicid=5378&subtopicid=67614#ch1_table3.4). The specific heat capacity of water is 4200 J kg−1 K−1.**
    $$C = \frac{Q}{m\delta T}$$
    $$C = \frac{}{1 * 100} $$
6. **Explain the importance of keeping a lid on a simmering saucepan of water in terms of latent heat of vaporisation.**
    With the lid on a saucepan the steam that is vaporised from water will float up and if there is a lid on the saucepan the steam will stay in the saucepan area and the latent heat will maintain the temperature
7. **How does the evaporation of water cause a reduction in the temperature of the remaining liquid water?**
