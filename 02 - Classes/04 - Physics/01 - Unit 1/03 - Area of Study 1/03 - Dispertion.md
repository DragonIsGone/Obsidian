#### 2.4 Exercise

1. **White light enters a crown glass rectangular prism. Sketch the path of red and deep blue light through the glass and back into air. How does the direction of the emerging coloured rays compare with that of the incoming white ray?**
        
    2. **Suggest why a glass triangle is used to observe the visible spectrum, rather than a glass rectangle.**
        a triangle has the entering and exiting normal at different angles meaning that the 
    
2. **Which travels faster through crown glass — red light or violet light? What is the speed difference?**
    Red light travels faster with a speed difference of about 
3. **Green and violet light enter a triangular prism. Which is bent more?**
    violet light gets bent more upon entering the prism
4. **A ray of white light in air strikes a rectangular glass block with an angle of incidence of 30°, as shown in the following diagram. For the glass block, the refractive index of red light is 1.514 and, for purple light, it is 1.530.**

    1. **On a copy of the diagram, carefully show the path taken by red light and by purple light.**
        
    2. **Use Snell’s Law to find the angle of refraction for both the red light and the purple light.**
        
    3. **Determine the angle between the red light ray and the purple light ray in the rectangular glass.**
        
5. **Red and violet beams of light enter a triangular prism at the same location and angle. The violet beam of light is refracted noticeably more than the red beam. What does this result indicate about the relative speeds of red and violet light in the material that the prism is made of?**

**_Source:_ _VCE 2019 Physics Exam, Section B, Q.15_; © VCAA** 

**A student sets up an experiment involving a source of white light, a glass prism and a screen. The path of a single ray of white light when it travels through the prism and onto the screen is shown in Figure 14.**

**[![](https://content2.learnon.com.au/secure/ebooks/97811198/9781119887843/images/c02f39.png)](https://content2.learnon.com.au/secure/ebooks/97811198/9781119887843/images/lightwindow/c02f39.png)**


**A spectrum of colours is observed by the student on the screen, which is positioned to the right of the prism.**

1. **Name and explain the effect observed by the student. **(3 marks)****
    This is a case of dispersion passing through a prisim, the light is split as it travels in and out leading to the different colours that travel at different speeds bending more and less causing a rainbow to appear.
2. **Points X and Y on Figure 14 represent either end of the visible spectrum observed by the student.**
    
    **Identify the two visible colours observed at point X and at point Y. **(1 mark)****
    
    X point = Red Y point = Violet

**A beam of white light is incident on a prism at an angle of 40.0°. The refractive indexes of the colours at each end of the visible light spectrum are shown in the following table.**

|**Colour**|**Refractive index**|
|---|---|
|Red|1.50|
|Violet|1.52|

1. **Calculate the angle of refraction for the red light. **(1 mark)****
    roughly 25.4 degrees
2. **Calculate the angle of refraction for the violet light. **(1 mark)****
    roughly 25.0 degrees
3. **Calculate the angle of the dispersed spectrum. **(1 mark)****
    25.4 - 25.0 = 0.4 degrees
4. **Calculate the speed of the violet light in the material. **(1 mark)****
    V=c/n
    V=10^8

**Dispersion is one of the pieces of evidence for why light acts as a wave.**

**Explain why this is.**
The dispersion occurs as each individual colour of light is a different wavelength and given that each colour behaves differently we can assume light is a wave

**Diamond and perspex are cut to exactly the same shape. The same white light source is used to illuminate the shapes.**

**Why does the diamond appear to sparkle more than the perspex?**
As the diamond has a higher refractive index meaning the angle of incident to create total internal reflection causing more "sparkling"

**White light is shone onto a rectangular prism.**

**Describe the difference between the light entering and leaving the block.**
