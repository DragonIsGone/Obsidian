#### 3.2 Exercise

1. Why is the Celsius scale of temperature commonly used rather than the Kelvin scale?

	

2. What is the main advantage of an absolute scale of temperature?
    
3. Estimate each of the following temperatures in kelvin.
    
    1. The maximum temperature in Melbourne on a hot summer’s day
        
    2. The minimum temperature in Melbourne on a cold, frosty winter’s morning
        
    3. The current room temperature
        
    4. The temperature of cold tap water
        
    5. The boiling point of water
        
4. The temperature of very cold water in a small test tube is measured with a large mercury-in-glass thermometer. The temperature measured is unexpectedly high. Suggest a reason for this.
    
5. Carbon dioxide sublimates, that is, goes directly from solid to gas, at −78.5 °C. What is this temperature in kelvin?
    
6. The temperature of the surface of Mars was measured by the Viking lander and ranged from 256 K to 166 K. What are the equivalent temperatures in degrees Celsius?
    
7. Use the particle theory to explain why you can smell what’s for dinner from the front door of your house.
    
8. Explain the difference between translational kinetic energy and other types of internal energy.
    
9. Use the particle theory to explain what happens when your cup of tea cools down over time.
    
10. Cling film on a warm bowl of soup placed in the fridge gets sucked down when it cools. Use the particle theory to explain this.
    
11. James Joule showed that mechanical energy could be transformed into the internal energy of a substance or object. The temperature of a nail, for example, can be raised by hitting it with a hammer. List as many examples as you can of the use of mechanical energy to increase the temperature of a substance or object.
    
12. Explain, in terms of the kinetic particle model, why a red-hot pin dropped into a cup of water has less effect on the water’s temperature than a red-hot nail dropped into the same cup of water.
    
13. Explain why energy is transferred from your body into the cold sea while swimming even though you have less internal energy than the surrounding cold water.
