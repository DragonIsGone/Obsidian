5.4 Examples
1. **What is the voltage supplied by a battery that gives 1.05 J of energy to 0.70 C of charge that passes through it?**
	E = VQ
	V = E/Q
	V = 1.05/0.70
	V = 1.5V

2. **Complete the following table by ﬁlling in the missing values from a–f.**

3. **A 6.0-V source supplies 3.6 × 10<sup>-4</sup> J of energy to a quantity of charge. Determine the quantity of charge in coulombs and microcoulombs**
	E = VQ
	Q = E/V
	Q = 6.0/(3.6x10<sup>-4</sup>)
	Q = 1666.7

5. **Explain why a torch runs off a 3 V battery, while a car needs to be connected to a 9 V battery.**
	A torch runs off 3V as there is less components in a torch that needs to be powered compared to in a car
6. **What is the emf of a battery that provides 9.0 J of energy to 6.0 C of charge?**
	V = E/Q
	V = 9/6
	V = 1.5
### 5.4 Exam questions
**Question 1 (1 mark)**
**As 4.0 C of charge passes through a light bulb, a quantity of electrical energy is transformed into 40 J of thermal energy and 8.0 J of light energy.**
*What is the voltage drop across the light bulb? Explain your reasoning.*
	V = E/Q
	V = 40/8
	V = 5
**Question 2 (1 mark)**
**How much electrical potential energy will 5.7 μC of charge transfer if it passes through a voltage drop of 6.0 V?**
	E = VQ
	E = 6 x 5.7 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
	E = 3.4 x 10<sup>-5</sup>
**Question 3 (1 mark)**
**Which of the following supplies more energy to an appliance?**
A. A 1.5-V battery with 2.7 C ﬂowing through it - 4.05
B. A 1.7-V battery with 2.5 C ﬂowing through it - 4.25
C. A 2.0-V battery with 2.2 C ﬂowing through it - 4.4
==D. A 2.4-V battery with 1.9 C ﬂowing through it - 4.56==
**Question 4 (1 mark)**
**Describe the difference between a 1.5-V battery and a 9-V battery.**
	A 1.5V battery will deliver 1.5 Joules per colon in a circuit while a 9.0V 
**Question 5 (2 marks)**
**A battery is used to power a small device. The device transforms 540 J of electrical energy as 60 C of charge passes through it.**
**What is the emf of the battery? Explain your reasoning.**
	The EMF of the battery equates to 
	V = E/Q
	V = 540/60
	V = 9
	As EMF is equal to the Voltage
