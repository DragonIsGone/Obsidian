**K1** - in any circut the sun of ll currents of all the flowing points
I in = I out

#### 6.2 Exercise

1. Explain what is meant by the following terms, as they relate to electric circuits.
    
    1. Junction
        Junctions are a connection between 2 or 3 conducting paths
    2. Current
	    The rate at which electrons flow through a circuit
    3. Voltage drop
        Amount of charge dispersed over a component
    4. Conductor
        A material that allows easy transfer of electrons
2. Determine the missing currents in the following figures. State the direction of the current in each case.

8. When the switch is closed, what is the voltage drop across it? ****(1 mark)****
    *
9. Show where you would connect a voltmeter to confirm your prediction of the voltage drop across the switch. **(1 mark)**
    across each side of the switch
10. Explain what happens when the switch is opened. ****(1 mark)****
    the circuit is open and cannot flow in a loop meaning the current is 0

A doorbell connected to a battery comprises a button at the door, the bell and wires. The bell only sounds after the button is pushed.

Why doesn’t the bell always sound?

because only when the button is pushed the circuit is complete otherwise the circuit is open and cannot flow
