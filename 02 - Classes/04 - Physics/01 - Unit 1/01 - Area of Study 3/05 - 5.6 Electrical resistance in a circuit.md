1. **How much energy is provided by a 6-V battery if a current of 3 A passes through it for 1 minute?**
E = V x I x T
E = 6 x 3 x 60
E = 1080 J
1. **At what rate is thermal energy being transferred to a wire if it has a resistance of 5 Ω and carries a current of 0.30 A?**
V = 1.5

3. **Calculate the resistance of the following globes if their ratings are:**
**a. 240 V, 60 W**
R = V^2 / P
R = 240^2 / 60
R = 960
**b. 6.0 V, 6.3 W**
R = V^2 / P
R = 6^2 / 6.3
R = 5.71
**c. 12 V, 40 W.**
R = V^2 / P
R = 12^2 / 40
R = 3.6

1. **What is the power rating of an electric jug if it has a resistance of 48 Ω when hot and is connected to a 240-V supply?**
P = 2(V) x R
P = 2(240) x 48
P = 23040 W
## 5.6 Exam questions
**Question 1 (1 mark)**
**An ohmic component is initially operating at voltage V1 and power P1. The voltage is now doubled (V2 = 2V1).**
**What is the new power (P2) in the component?**
A. 4P1
B. 2P1
C. 0.5P1
D. 0.25P1

**Question 2 (3 marks)**
**Bill and Ben are discussing Ohm’s Law.**
**Bill describes it as ‘voltage is directly proportional to current’. Ben replies, ‘No, it should be expressed**
**as V = IR.’**
**Which of these statements is correct? Or are they both valid? Justify your answer.**
They are both correct as ohmic resistors are proportional with the formula V = IR
**Question 3 (3 marks)**
**A component draws a current of 0.50 A at a voltage drop of 12.5 V and a current of 1.2 A at a voltage drop of 30 V. Is the component displaying ohmic behaviour? Justify your answer.**
R = V/I
R = 12.5/0.5 = 25
R = 30/1.2 = 25
The resistor is ohmic as the resistance value remains the same


## Non-Ohmic resistors
- Thermistors
NTC - Negative temperature coeffiient

PTC - Positive temperature coeficcient

**Light dependent resistors (LDR)**
- resistor based on light level
- sensitive to small changed in illumination
- Generally LDR for detecting light signals
- used in garden lighting
**Diodes**
- act as voltage controlled switch
- one way valve
- **Reverse bias** and **forward bias**
