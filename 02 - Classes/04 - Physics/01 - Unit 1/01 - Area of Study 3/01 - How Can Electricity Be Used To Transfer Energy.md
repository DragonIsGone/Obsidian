## Exercises
### 5.2 Exercises

1. **After a plastic pen is rubbed with a piece of wool it can be used to attract small pieces of paper. Describe what has happened in terms of electric charge.**
	- The rubbing of the plastic pen against the wool left the pen with net negative charge from the transferred electrons when the pen is brought close to the neutral paper
2. **After rubbing a balloon on your clean dry hair, the balloon should try to stick to your hair when you attempt to remove it. Explain why this occurs.** 
	- When the balloon is rubbing against the clean dry air it has electrons transferred to it, this makes the balloon negatively charged while making the hair positively charged which causes the two sides to attract 
3. **If you separately rub two balloons on your hair and then hold them near each other, what will happen? Explain why this occurs.**
	- Rubbing two balloons on your hair will make both of the balloons negatively charged therefor making it so that the two balloons repel each other due to the electrostatic force repelling like-charged objects
4. **After walking across a nylon carpet in woollen socks and then touching a metal doorknob it is possible to get an electric shock. Explain why this occurs.**
	- When walking around on the carpet the socks will rub off electrons on the floor, this makes both you and your socks negatively charged, when you go to touch the door handle which is connected to the earth and neutral the charges attract each other causing a shock.
5. **What is an insulator?**
	- An insulator is a material that does not have electrons to carry charge therefor preventing current from passing through it

### 5.2 Exam Questions
**Question 1 (1 mark)**
**MC What term best describes the charge carriers when metals conduct electricity?**
- *D) Electrons* Electrons are freely moving through metal making them able to move from one object to another

**Question 2 (1 mark)**
**MC Two objects are placed next to each other and are attracted.**
**It is most correct to state that**
- *D) each object will have an unequal amount of electrons and protons.* if two objects are attracted to each other they will have opposite, non neutral charge which occurs through uneven amounts of protons and neutrons

**Question 3 (2 marks)**
**Why are the wires that connect circuit components always made of metal?**
- Wires in circuits are always made from metals as metals are conductors, this means that the metal wire can efficiently transfer the charge along the length as the free moving electrons in metals are easily moved

**Question 4 (2 marks)**
**After rubbing a balloon in her hair, Chris brought it very close to an aluminium can lying on a ﬂat table. When she**
**slowly moved the balloon away from the can it started to roll and follow the balloon.**
**Describe why this happened**
- After rubbing the balloon on her hair the balloon became negatively charged due to the electron transfer when she placed the balloon near the neutrally charged can the opposite electrostatic forces pulled the two objects together

**Question 5 (3 marks)**
**Many materials can be deﬁned as conductors or insulators.**
**a. Deﬁne and provide an example of a conductor.**
**b. Explain how these differ from semiconductors.**
	a) A conductor is an object that can efficently transfer electrons. Copper is a conductor and is used within wires as it is a metal it has delocalized electrons that can freely move making it efficient at transferring charge 
	b) A semiconductor differs from a regular conductor as electrons can only flow through them during certain conditions, an example of this would be silicon



### 5.4 Examples
9. **What is the voltage supplied by a battery that gives 1.05 J of energy to 0.70 C of charge that passes through it?**
	E = VQ
	V = E/Q
	V = 1.05/0.70
	V = 1.5V

10. **Complete the following table by ﬁlling in the missing values from a–f.**

11. **A 6.0-V source supplies 3.6 × 10<sup>-4</sup> J of energy to a quantity of charge. Determine the quantity of charge in coulombs and microcoulombs**
	E = VQ
	Q = E/V
	Q = 6.0/(3.6x10<sup>-4</sup>)
	Q = 1666.7
12. u
13. **Explain why a torch runs off a 3 V battery, while a car needs to be connected to a 9 V battery.**
	A torch runs off 3V as there is less components in a torch that needs to be powered compared to in a car
14. **What is the emf of a battery that provides 9.0 J of energy to 6.0 C of charge?**
	V = E/Q
	V = 9/6
	V = 1.5
### 5.4 Exam questions
**Question 1 (1 mark)**
**As 4.0 C of charge passes through a light bulb, a quantity of electrical energy is transformed into 40 J of thermal energy and 8.0 J of light energy.**
*What is the voltage drop across the light bulb? Explain your reasoning.*
	V = E/Q
	V = 40/8
	V = 5
**Question 2 (1 mark)**
**How much electrical potential energy will 5.7 μC of charge transfer if it passes through a voltage drop of 6.0 V?**
	E = VQ
	E = 6 x 5.7 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
	E = 3.4 x 10<sup>-5</sup>
**Question 3 (1 mark)**
**Which of the following supplies more energy to an appliance?**
A. A 1.5-V battery with 2.7 C ﬂowing through it - 4.05
B. A 1.7-V battery with 2.5 C ﬂowing through it - 4.25
C. A 2.0-V battery with 2.2 C ﬂowing through it - 4.4
==D. A 2.4-V battery with 1.9 C ﬂowing through it - 4.56==
**Question 4 (1 mark)**
**Describe the difference between a 1.5-V battery and a 9-V battery.**
	A 1.5V battery will deliver 1.5 Joules per colon in a circuit while a 9.0V 
**Question 5 (2 marks)**
**A battery is used to power a small device. The device transforms 540 J of electrical energy as 60 C of charge passes through it.**
**What is the emf of the battery? Explain your reasoning.**
	The EMF of the battery equates to 
	V = E/Q
	V = 540/60
	V = 9
	As EMF is equal to the Voltage
