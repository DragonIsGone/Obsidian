### Formulas
R = V/I
or
V = IR
P = I^2 x R

Si unit for resistances are ohms **Ω**
### Ohmic conductor
- ohmic conductors obey ohms law
- a plot of an Ohmic resistor are linear relations of voltage and current

### Non-Ohmic conductors
- a non-ohmic resistor/conductor doesn't consistently 

## 5.5 Questions

1. **Calculate the current drawn by:**
**a. a 60-W light globe connected to a 240 V source**
P = VI 
I = P/V
I = 60/240
I = 0.25 A
I = 25 mA
**b. a 40-W globe with a voltage drop of 12 V across it**
I = P/V
I = 40/12
I = 3.3* A
**c. a 6.0-V, 6.3-W globe when operating normally**
I = P/V
I = 6.3/6.0
I = 1.05
**d. a 1200-W, 240-V toaster when operating normally.**
I = P/V
I = 1200/240
I = 5 A
## 5.5 Exam questions
1. **An electric jug is connected to a 240-V supply and draws a current of 3.3 A. How long would it take to transfer 3.2 × 10^4 J of energy to its contents?**
==I = Q/T==
==T = I/Q
T = 3.3/3.2 * 10^4 
T = 10312.5 seconds
T = 171 Minuets==
2. **Mark wanted to calculate the energy used by a 4.5-kW air conditioner each week. The air conditioner was only turned on for Physics classes, which were one hour long and conducted four times a week. Mark believed the air conditioner used 18 kJ of energy. was Mark correct? What mistake did he make when doing the calculation?**

3. **The element of a heater has a voltage drop of 240 V across it.**
**a. In terms of energy, what does this mean?**
**b. How much energy is transformed into thermal energy in the element if 25 C of charge ﬂow through it?**
