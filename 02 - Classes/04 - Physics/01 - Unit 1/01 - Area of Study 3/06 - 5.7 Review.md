1. **During a storm a lightning bolt discharges 3 million kJ of energy to Earth in 0.75 ms. The discharge involves the movement of 15 C of charge. What is the potential difference between the lightning source and Earth?**
V = E/Q
V = (3 x 10^6) / 15
V = 200000
V = 2 x 10^5 V
2. **An electric kettle operating off a 240-V power supply uses 2.7 kW when boiling water.**
*a. What is the current in the kettle?*
I = P/V
I = 2700/240
I = 11.25
*b. When the kettle is on for 2.5 minutes, how much energy does it use?*
E = VIT
E= 240 x 11.25 x 150
E = 405000 J
3. **a. What is the voltage drop across a 44-Ω resistor carrying a current of 2.5 A?**
V = IR
V = 2.5 x 44
V = 110 V
	**b. What would be the effect of connecting the same resistor to a larger power supply?**
The resistance would be the same assuming it it an ohmic resistor and it would get hotter due to increased current flow

4. **A children’s toy comprises a 9-V battery, a switch and an electric motor in a simple circuit as shown in the**
**following ﬁgure. The motor is labelled ‘9 V, 25 mA’.**

**a. When the switch is closed, what is the maximum rate at which the battery can supply energy to the motor?**
9 Joules per colomb

5. **A handheld fan is powered by two 1.5-V batteries. When tested at room temperature, 15 C of charge ﬂowed  through it every minute.**
**a. What was the current in the device?**
I = Q/T
I = 15/120
I = 0.125
**b. What is the resistance of the device?**
R = V/I
R = 1.5/0.125
R = 12
1. **The voltage supplied to a tungsten globe is varied. The current and the potential difference across the lamp are measured and the results plotted in the following graph**
![[{3264CD27-7B3B-4F4D-8002-3043B96AAE6F}.png]]
**a. Calculate the resistance of the globe when the current is 0.2 A.**
V = 2
R = V/I
R = 2/0.2
R = 10 ohms
**b. Would you describe the globe as ohmic or non-ohmic? Justify your answer.**
Non ohmic as the graph is not linear as the resistance exponentially increases as voltage increasesT
