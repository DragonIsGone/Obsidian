Brutalism was a post world war 2 building style that emerged in the united kingdom. As the cold war emerged new building styles also came to being. Brutalism was a simplistic building style designed around the idea of "Form follows function" where there was great influence placed on the structural elements of the house. Brutalism was influence by the emergence of "utilitarians" and new materials such as steel and concrete. A call for low cost social housing lead to building being built as cheaply and bare bones as possible.
