**Q 16**
While the marking scheme simply says to get the mark you have to get the definitions "correct" my answers compared to textbook answers:

Annuity:
Textbook - annuity involves money being deposited in an investment and then withdrawn over time in the form of regular payments... ...That is the value of the annuity eventually reached zero.
My answer - Annuities provide higher monthly payments while the principle slowly reduces

Perpetuity:
Textbook - "the payments that are equal to the interest earned can be made forever"
My answer - "Perpetuity have lower monthly payouts but will not "Run out" 

The answer I provided answered the question of what are the advantaged and disadvantages of annuity vs perpetuity
Annuity, pros: "high monthly payment", cons: "principle slowly reduces" 
Perpetuity, pros: "principle does not 'run out'", cons: "lower monthly payments"
