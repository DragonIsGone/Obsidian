#### Issue
- The issue about the problems he gets from ice and the effects that it has on his surrounding family and how drug users have a difficult time

The issue the author is looking to suggest is the problem with drug addiction and how it acts in a legal system and how it needs to be changed. 

#### Contention
- The drug laws need to change
- Police, courts and prison not best

The contention the author looks to provide is to remake the laws around drug addiction into a 3 strike rehabilitation policy
#### Sub Arguments
- Drug use can ruin highly sucessful people
- Keeping up with the youth ?
- 3 strikes system, instead of going to court for the first time you go to rehab and only after 3 times do you go to prison

The sub arguments include how drug use is not confined to a single demographic in society and anyone is vunerable to it

- Luck of the draw - if legistation helps
