### Introduction

Imagine students watching an informational video at school probably learning about the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, before the bell sounds and everyone goes home. The teacher asks the students to finish the video at home but alas, they are not old enough to watch YouTube. This is an imminent issue in which children may be prevented from using apps for communicative, entertainment and social purposes. This fa√ßade of child saftey simply exists to give companies an excuse to keep gathering more and more data on us to feed us ads. In June 2025 many media outlets including the ABC picked up on the government's online safety act and its broader implications. These include the erosion of privacy, companies learning everything about you and the inabilities for parents to care for their own children.

According to the office of the Australian information commissioner, "Anonymity and pseudonymity are important privacy concepts. They enable individuals to exercise greater control over their personal information and decide how much personal information will be shared or revealed to others." I believe that the requirement to provide ID, as seen in other countries who enacted similar legislation like the UK with many petitions to revert those law. This is a blatant disregard for the ideas of privacy. Furthermore can we really trust companies with sensitive government issued IDs? There was a "record breaking" 1,113 notifications of data breaches. This was a 25% increase from 893 notifications in 2023. These data breaches could end up with ID's beings sold on the black market and as we all know "Identity theft isn't a joke". These ideas prove the absurdity of the planned legislations in regard to data protection.

Companies immediately adopting new ideas nearly always means there is money in it. User data is the goldmine for personalized ads. It wouldn't be new as Mark Zuckerberg have been known for using both teenager's emotional state and menstrual cycles for the sake of targeted advertising. If this activity is not called out and stopped we would end up with every facet of our lives being monitored to send extremely personal advertisements that will manipulate you into buying things you don't need.

Finally the emergent pattern of "childproofing" the internet exists due to parents inability to control their kids. The "soft parenting" trend of allowing kids to do whatever they want has lead to this need for childproofing. It is an obvious fact that parents need to watch over their kids, therefor there should be no burden on online companies or governments to create legislation to prevent kids from staying on the internet. After all, if parents don't teach their kids about things, society will and they will be a lot less nice about it.

Many people will claim that all these policy are for the saftey and innocence of the next generation, while the could be true the guardian and other sources report how "breaking news footage, war coverage, investigative journalism and political protest material [were classified] as harmful content." This is censorship in every definition of the word. People will also say that "its not that big of a deal" but it is setting the standard of give and inch, take a mile. If we don't push back now it is allowing governments to push more authoritarian censorship policies through.

I way forward for this solution follows a call for better moderation of content on social media platforms. The burden should be placed on companies to uphold their standards to prevent children from seeing the horrors of the world. There should also be emphasis on parents watching their child's online activity and determining what they can do rather than creating a blanket rule in which affects people's privacy and freedom of speech.
	
In summary I believe that the strong pushes towards child saftey on the internet and the prevention of access is not beneficial in the long term for children as they will not learn the self discipline and critical thinking required these days. Such policies will give companies an all you can eat buffet of personal data to manipulate you into spending money and can we really even trust these greedy companies to not leak your personal data?
