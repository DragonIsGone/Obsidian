Reginald Rose's courtroom play 12 angry men depicts many different types of behaviour in the jurors. Rose puts forward an idea in the play that human nature is simply flawed and weak. This is shown through the racist, ageist and other prejudice found in jurors with the abject laziness. Rose also utilises depictions of the quiet and reserved jurors who simply go where the herd goes to stay out of trouble. On a counter rose includes cases where some of the Jurors end up putting trust in their fellow man. These points culminate in the play's depiction of human nature.

Prejudice is a major theme and motif from the play. Many jurors have different forms of it ranging from racism and ageism to family connections and past experiences. Many of the team negative jurors find that their prejudice about the boy on trial gets in the way of their critical thinking such as Juror 4's comment on the slum where the boy grew up "having nothing nothing good come out of there." there is also juror 10's racist rant in regard to how he believes that "they don't need any big excuse to kill someone". The prejudice that these jurors carry is a parody of the ideas of communism during the McCarthy trials, where it was treated as nothing more than a buzzword for something you didn't like. This link to Rose's intent helps to underline a key depiction of the play in regards to human nature and it's flaws.

Many of the minor characters simply stay as minor character because of their lack of contribution to the deliberation. These jurors such as juror 2 and juror 11 are quiet throughout both acts of the play. While these jurors do hold strong beliefs such as juror 2 agreeing with juror 8 in how "there are some people who haven't spoken yet". Juror 2 being unsure to express something like this is a response to trying to not look "alien" in the group which is parodied by Juror 11 where across act 2 of the play he constantly flips his vote between "guilty" and "not guilty" based on whichever vote seems to be popular at the time. These flaws in the characters of the play outline Rose's intent of displaying how for justice to operate effectively people need to feel free to express their opinions without the risk of being alienated, something that was absent during the time of the "red scare". The flaws in confidence to speak out helps to display that human nature is flawed.

Reasonable doubt is a key idea, not only in the play but in many courts around the world. Juror 8 spearheads the idea of reasonable doubt throughout the deliberation process. Juror 8 being the highlight of the jury runs through the utilisation of reasonable doubt. This is doubled by juror 9's willingness to "hear him out". when asked about what if the boy was guilty he comes with no answer other than "I don’t know whether he’s guilty or not. But we have a reasonable doubt" this shows the inherent and only flaw with reasonable doubt, where there is the possibility through the kind and logical thinking reasonable doubt can set a guilty person free. The idea that even kind hearted intentions can still be flawed is Rose's display on the justice systems relation to human flaws.

In summary Rose's play depicts an idea of human nature, whether kind or malicious is inherently flawed in the justice system. Prejudice, racism and ageism obstruct the logical thoughts key for a jury deliberation. This is stacked on with people general desire to fit in and not be the odd one out from risk of being alienated. Even the best intention of giving someone resonable doubt still risks them being guilty. It is these points that Rose links the Twelve angry men play to the McCarthy trials during the cold war and conveys to the reader while human nature may be flawed we still should try our best.
