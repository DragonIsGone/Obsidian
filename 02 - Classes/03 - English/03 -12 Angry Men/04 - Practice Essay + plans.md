It is the weakest members of the jury who gain the most from the deliberation process.’ What extent do you agree

Quiet jurors get a voice
Many jurors stand up for each other during the deliberation (combat of prej/stero)



Weaker jurors may just vote the popular vote (failure of civic duty)

The novel American novel “Twelve Angry Men” by Reginald Rose follows the story of a jury deliberation of a boy’s murder trial. The men deliberating in the jury room vary in their ability to argue their point, many of the quiet jurors much. Through this is compared with Rose's portrayal of prejudice and stereotypes in the deliberation while being contrasted with the many cases of the failure of civic duty. This points show that Rose's main intention with the play was displaying that the weaker members of the jury gain the most during the deliberation process.

Juror 9 is a quiet character through most of the play, the deliberation of evidence allows him to bring his personal insight into the case, however many of a team guilty jurors brush off his insights as nothing. Stereotypes are a key theme of 12 angry men.

Rose provide and explores the idea of civic duty throughout the play. While the deliberation provided an uplift in the voices of some jurors who were previously unheard of some of the jurors such as juror 7 fail civic duty. Moreover when he changes vote because he’s “sick of this already” he doesn’t change his vote based on his belief he changes his vote from a desire to leave as soon as possible. Juror 11 is a contrast of this when he shouts at the 11 juror "you sat here voting guilty because there are baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket!" this outcry shows juror 11's belief and roses ideal example of civic duty compared to reality of the world and how many people chose to simply follow the common norm during the McCarthyism period. This analysis of characters help to disprove that the weakest members get the most from deliberation as many of the weaker jurors outright fail civic duty during the deliberation.
