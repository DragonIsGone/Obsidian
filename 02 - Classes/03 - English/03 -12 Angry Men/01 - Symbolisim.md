### The Switch Knife
#### Second Reality
- supposedly "Unique"
- Juror 8 purchases one to undermine the brokers statement
- Exposes the conflict on intrest
#### A link to environment
- Knife is associated with "slum" background
- juror 5 knowledge gives insight into such background
- showing lived experience is useful in revelation of truth

### Eyeglasses
#### "Flawed Witness"
- Not wearing glasses in court
- glasses indentation
- unknown defect in witness
- The el-train passing by
#### Parallel to the jury
- witness choose not to wear glasses (out of vanity)
- jurors initially do not "see" the truth

#### A Moment of Clarity
- laster juror to be swayed is juror 4 who wears glasses
- he is able to see with new "clearer" eyes once this detail is pointed out
- no way of identifying the killer being the boy beyond **RESONABLE DOUBT**

### The defence lawyer
- The defence lawyer doesn't try
- no money of fame in the case
- court appointed lawyer
- "How much does this trial cost"
- law and order are at risk as soon as those who can pay deserve better representation
- boy is only aquitted because of the analysis the jury did the defence failed to do
- "Groups who deserve support and protection and those who don't"

### The Storm
- Hottest day in new york
- Storm outside mirrors rising tension in the jury room
- clash between emotion guilty vs rational not guilty
- rain represents cooling effect of lodgic and reason during second act
- controls the emotions present in act 1 during act 2
- act 2 calmer than act 1
- lights being flood of reason
- "push back" darkness of prejudice and emotion
- storm has catharsis of the fear in jurors to be mocked
- world restored to order wanted, social/moral
- "Vicarour" - "at one remove"
- Storm passing gives clarty
- order has been restored

### The window
- View is the new york skyline
- all jurors had come from there
- people are more intrested in ball games then participating in law
- window physically seperates juror 8 at the beggining
- juror 8 looking out the window and reflecting on the case
- division ot unity, window stands against
- "Open or close the window" - shows to differences  in the jury, non coherent
- symbol of unity and transperancy

### The secret ballot
#### Unbiased ideal
- open vote causes peer presure
- secret ballot get true opinions
#### A democratic process
- recurring votes represent democratic process in action
- track shift opinion
- votes called at all strategic times
#### Coming together
- votes force the men to come ogether
- come together to make decision
- reflecting broader challenges
