Toni Jordan's Australian novel *Nine Days* follows the story of multiple generations of families in Melbourne and their stories. While the story focuses on the lives of the people of Richmond, the places play an equally important part to the story. Many places in the text emphasises key themes like family and belonging such as the Westaway's Richmond house and the nursing home at the end of the book and the decision that are made as a result of how closed in the suburb of Richmond was. These elements help to show the underlying idea of places are as import as the people in the story.

The family home in Richmond is one of the most important location of the entire novel, being a link between the past generations of the families in the 1940s and the later generation in the 2000s. Francis is shown to be alone and isolated in the family home as after the humiliation of his cover being blown Francis retreats into his own life of isolation, never going out and never meeting anyone. Francis declares how "Everything I  need is here. I don't need to be anywhere else." Francis living in the old family choice as he has been socially cast out, the significance of the house shows that maybe he never truly grew up and is still trying to relive his old life. This is in comparison to the Westaway's at the start of the book who feel "trapped" within Richmond, unable to escape into a better life with Francis being the only person who was likely to with a scholarship and all. This ~~shows~~ how places and setting in the novel are just as important as characters that exist in them but to also to place a stage to see the evolution of a characters thoughts and feeling.

The nursing home at the end of the book is a pivotal location, being centred around alecs journey. The nursing home bring a sense of family into the closing chapters of the book where Kip and Alec relate over the photo of Connie and Jack where Kip says to Alec how "you've give me my sister back, Alec." The nursing home brings Alec closer to kip and his advice. ==The structure of nursing home also displays how the traditional family structure flex, bends and changes. Jordan uses these places of emphasize how family structure needs to be flexible and changes under social needs change==. However Kip and Alecs relation still show the main idea behind family still exists regardless of the family structure. These points of location help Jordan's authorial intent to key ideas by using the setting to highlight evidence of the themes.

==Privacy within Richmond in the 1940s is largely unheard of as everyone knew everyone. If something happened, everyone in the area knew of it==. The social pressure of an environment like this greatly impact the lives of many of the characters. Connie is a key point in this regard as her abortion is forced upon her by Jean as in her mind if Connie gives birth her "life (will) be ruined" and thought of how Connie would be seen as a "loose woman". these parts of the text show how the choices that Jean made for Connie was to not only save Connie's reputation but her own as well, without knowing that the choice would end up with Connie bleeding to death. Richmond as a small section of the world also plays an interesting part in Jacks story. Jack being one of the only characters to have seen the world outside of it is understandably hesitant on being shipped out to war as he had seen "death at close quarters" and was sceptical about the excitement of war that appear all around him. These two places show that not only the peer pressure that comes from everyone knowing everyone but also the lack of knowledge coming from Richmond being so small shows that places play a major role within the story of the novel.


In summary the relatively small amount of locations shown within the novel help to highlight Jordan's authorial intent to prove how settings are designed to compliment the story and convey its messages through the evolution of character with connection across different time periods to the emphasis on family and the different forms it take while still keeping the core purpose. Finally with the  social expectations of Richmond from the time period. These prove how Jordan's intent was to have locations of nine days is just as important as character in the text.

The novel "*Nine Days*", by Toni Jordan, interconnects the stories of many people throughout different time periods. In the novel the monotony of life in the periods are contrast by joy including finding love with others and interconnection and shared experiences can help to bond people despite hardship, however Jordan also looks to into how life can still remove joy even if it seems life is good with unforeseen catastrophes. These examples show that Jordan's authorial intent shows that despite everyday drudgery characters can still find joy throughout the story.

Love is a key motif in the story, through love characters can can overcome the trial and tribulation of their lives it appears at many times throughout the text. Jack and Connie though divided, look to be together, Jack would  "die a happy man" if Connie would "let [him] kiss [her]", this displays how Jack's mundane life can still contain joy through his love for Connie. The inverse is also true where all the Connie want is for Jack to "just come back". These are pieces of dramatic irony are revisited Jean's chapter we know that Jack did end up dying in the war and never managed to return to Connie. Through this Jordan highlight the drudgery of life love can be used to overcome the hardships of life, we can use this in our lives by taking time to be with people who love us.

 Nine Days contains many instances of unconventional family structure, Jordan conveys the theming of the importance of family throughout the book. Kip and Annabel both were a part of unconventional family structures, Annabel was "in a munition factory, before the men came home" while Kip would be a "proper worker" working for Mr Husting. Both Kip and Annabel had to work monotonous labour just to provide for their families but through the similar experiences they found joy in each others company as "we're all so close together" this sentence proves that Annabel and Kip has bonded together. Jordan proves how despite everyday hardships the characters endure they can still find joy, we can use this in our own lives as when we surround ourselves with friends who are like us life gets ever so easier.

Jean is a unique case in the novel, a mother who gets stuck having to work to provide for her family. Jean's life was going well for her, she had picked up "a house halfway up the hill" and she already had her dreams of "being at home and raising children", however Tom Westaway dies off the back of a tram while drunkenly fare evading causing Jean's plans to flip causing her life to be bogged down with trying to provide for her family. Jean's plans of having kids ends up being a determent to her as "[Kip] reminds [Jean] of [Tom]" conveying that the dreams that Jean once had ended up contributing to the dark monotony of her life. The employment of these points disproves how all characters in the novel have their drugged down life still find joy and some characters may have that joy overshadowed by unforeseen problems.

in summary Jordan's intent to show in the book is how characters find joy in their lives despite the hardships of the time period. Whether it was through love or bonding through similar circumstances many of the character managed to find love however not all of them still did with unforeseen incidents dramatically and rapidly changing their lives. Jordan's overall intention was to prove that joy can be found during the hardship but also hardship can easily come in times of joy we can sue this in our own lives by not only enjoying the moment you are in but also knowing that if things don't look good there is always joy somewhere.
