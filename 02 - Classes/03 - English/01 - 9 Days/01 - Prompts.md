 >9 days shows to its readers that its important to choose your role models carefully
## Writing

The historical fiction novel "Nine Days" by Toni Jordan highlights the criticality that picking positive role models can have on people in society. When you "pick" a role model there might be unforeseen influences that could change a person and whether the person is ready to undertake being a role model. We also see that parents can be role models for their children's behavior.

Toni Jordan's comparison between Kip and Francis highlights how role models can have a significant impact on morals. Both Kip and Francis loose their father Tom Westaway when they are very young, Francis copes with this event by retreating into a make believe world where he is the world renowned spy "Cranston Lament" Francis's lack of a father figure and his imagination eventually leads him to unkind groups of bullies who draw him into robbing a widow in which he obtains the amethyst pendent. The amethyst pendent is shown to be Francis's turning point, where his secret of robbing the widow was revealed when he tried to give the pendent to Annabel, before running off out of shame after kip bought the pendent. Kip while going through the same situation as Francis came out better as they are more kind hearted this shows that the choosing the right role model is beneficial.

This idea in the book can also relate to many athletes who find themselves in a role model position. The problem with this is many athletes don't sign onto or just don't realize that they would become role models for many young children in society who see these athletes as hero's. The media then spins up stories on how these supposed heroes to young children go out to bars to drink all night, get into scuffles with others and end up not looking like the hero material they were set out to be. The ideas of who we choose as roll models in our society should also look toward if the roll model is willing to be one.

In nine days the relationship between Alec and his grandfather Kip in comparison to his friends is displaying a stark difference between who to choose as role models. In the final parts of the book Alec is presented with a crossroads; to go hang out with his friend, or to deliver the picture to Kip. Alec decision to go deliver the picture to kip intern ends up saving his life as Alec later reads his friends died in a car crash. Toni whished to display how doing the right thing and choosing who he wanted to base his actions off of Alec's life was spared.

Choosing role models can be beneficial for our lives, choosing the right people to look up to is a key message of the text. An example of this existing in our society is parents. Most parents try to teach their children what is best for them, if they listen is another story, however as a whole parents are one of the best role models for children as they use their lived experiences to inform their children how to behave
