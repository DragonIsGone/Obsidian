In the novel "Nine Days" by Toni Jordan the idea of how the relationship with family and the shared impacts of external events shape the lives of many character in the book. Through the short and long term impacts of World War Two and how many of the families in the book contain unconventional family structures because of it. This ties into our world where many people join together in the face of tragic events to help as much as they can and the connections and traditions many indigenous people have.

World War Two is by far the most prevalent event throughout the book where it influences the lives of the families who live through it. Annabel's life is very much shaped by the war she was living with, when the men went off to fight women like Annabel would get jobs in munition factories but even when the war was over she would have to go back and take care of her shell shocked father showing the long term impacts of the war. The war also impacts Connie as after learning of Jack's passing she realizes that her baby will have no father leading to a backyard abortion and eventually her death. Jordan displays how these widespread events can have diverse and long lasting effects on people even those who were not directly a part of it, displaying how family and external events shape the lives of many.

Shared experiences are one of the strongest bonds some people have, your life can be changed by these such experiences. Bushfires are a key staple of Australia, with them so common many plants are adapted to germinate their seeds in them however, tragedy does strike when these fires roar into towns and decimate everything in their path. Many people directly impacted by the fires have their lives changed forever, they may have lost their house, pets or even loved ones although like the seeds of a new tree growing after a fire many people can find new relations in their community and abroad, with a shared experience many people can join with other people in stronger bonds and like Kip finding Annabel after the war and starting a successful family, something he never had, he   people can find new life within their community and to reshape people's lives. 

Many of the family in the novel do not follow the conventional structure for the the time with parents making money and the kids in school. The Westaway's however don't get the luxury of following the normal structure. When Tom Westaway dies while drunkenly fare evading on the tram The rest of the Westaway's lives pivot around to support the family; while Jean goes to become a domestic servant to put bread on the table Connie puts her dreams to the side to support her brothers. Francis being younger than Kip never got a chance to have the support of Tom when he was growing up he would create imaginary world for himself, without a father figure Francis' life goes from a successful future to robbing old widows of their jewelry. The many changes in the Westaway family displays Jordan's intent to show how the structure of family greatly influences and shapes the lives that we live.

Family is a precious connection, people who love one another and will do anything for them is one of the major ideas that makes us human. This connection can stretch back hundred upon hundreds of years with generation after generation passing down their knowledge, songs and stories. Like the pendent and the shilling in the novel passing down knowledge to the next generation, such knowledge like sustainable use of the lands could be a key mold in reshaping our lives. Jordan emulates this in the text through The amethyst pendent giving knowledge to Charlotte over what to do with her baby. These ideas show how Jordan's intention was to prove how families can shape our lives through generational knowledges passed down from one to another.

In conclusion Nine Days brings around key ideas of shaping peoples lives through familiar relationships and great external events was Jordan's intention in conveying a story. Through the events of World War 2 impacting the lives of many of the characters through pain and death which as we see in our world can be renewed and resharpened into new connections in communities. This accompanies the connections in Family where the Westaway's have to reshape their lives after Tom dies leaving a hole in the family leading to a rehappening of all their lives with knew knowledge to pass down to the next generation shaping their lives in the process. These points show how the Characters of the novel have their lives shaped by the events of the novel and the family decisions.
