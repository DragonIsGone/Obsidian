### Personal Expirience

### Theme: **Family and Sacrifice**

- Observed how Kip sacrifices personal ambitions for the sake of his family’s stability — reminded me of times my parents put our needs before their own.
    
- Witnessed Jean’s sense of duty toward her mother and siblings — made me reflect on the silent responsibilities older siblings in my family carry.
	
- Family and the connection to country 
### Theme: **Resilience and Hardship**

- Jack hustles for work during the Depression, yet maintains optimism — reminded me of people in my life who stay hopeful during tough financial times.
    
- The characters adapt to loss and change (e.g., Alec after his father’s death) — similar to my experience of watching a friend cope with grief over time.
### Theme: **Gender Roles and Expectations**

- Connie’s story highlights the consequences of societal judgement on women — echoed stories my grandmother told about growing up with strict expectations.
    
- Annabel’s later confidence as a photographer — reminded me of seeing someone in my life break gender norms to follow their creative path.
### Theme: **Intergenerational Perspectives**

- The shifting narrative across decades made me think about how values change — like realizing how different my parents’ teenage years were from mine.
    
- Observed how legacies are passed down (e.g., the photo of Connie) — made me reflect on how old family photos or stories shape my sense of identity.


- Way friends and peer presusre can cause problems

**Chapter 5 – Francis**

„Francis if you get out of bed again so help me I‟ll brain you,‟ says the guard. (P120)  

Then I see it. The kitchen. The cakes. (P121)  

The cakes have been coming for three days, ever since the funeral. (P121)

Today will be the hardest. The funeral wasn‟t too bad... back to school, that‟s what I‟ve been dreading. (P126)

  

„Our good deeds to help the less fortunate.‟ (P128)

  

„We think you‟d be the ideal boy to join our gang.‟ (P128)

The toughest gang in Richmond! And they want me, Francis Westaway! (P129)

  

„Did you not bloody well hear me? I didn‟t say goodbye to Dad.‟ (P131)

  

I want to tell him he‟s not being practical, that he needs to think of his future, of Ma and Connie‟s. (P132)

  

And I‟ve got one second to make up my mind and all I can think about is Dad but then I think about Kip walking out of school and I‟m not walking away from anything so I run after them. (P133)

  

„Don‟t disappoint us. You wouldn‟t like us when we‟re disappointed.‟ (P137)

Chapter Six- Annabel

The war is over and we won. Or so they say. (P148)

He feels the shame of asking; me of lying. (P149)
  

It was different when I was in the munitions factory, before the men came home. (P150)

Being with him on a bad day is like watching a storm break in the distance. (P151)

It‟s just when he‟s like this, my mother‟s name is still the easiest to find. (P153)

  

„You know I don‟t like that boy,‟ he says. „I don‟t trust him.‟ (P153)

„Not him [Francis]. He‟s harmless. The other one. Kip.‟ (P153)

  

I‟ll always look after my dad. Not every man would‟ve kept a child, especially a girl, when his wife died giving birth to her. (P157)

He‟s kept it all these years, hidden away, waiting for the right girl. (P158)

  

For the first time since he‟s been back I notice how much he‟s filled out, broadened. (P162-163)

Half of Melbourne knows why Kip took his time, of course. (P164)

„Jack Husting, what happened to him again? North Africa.‟ (P165)

Francis always pretends to be big and tough as if he doesn‟t care what anyone else thinks.‟ (P165)

  

„It was a little story I told her. She falls for anything‟. (P166)

  

„... the nuns taught you how to act like a lady instead of a fishwife.‟ (P168)

„To think I was going to ask your father tonight. What a lucky escape.‟ (P169)

  

„We‟re all so close together around here. There‟s no way to keep secrets.‟ (P170)

  

„I‟m asking you to let someone else be honourable for a change.‟ (P170)

„You‟re a bloody idiot, Kip,‟ says Francis. „Always were, always will be.‟ (P171)

I‟ve already made up my mind. (P171)

  

„Kip Westaway. Francis‟s brother. Why don‟t you like him?‟ (P173)

„Take you away from me,‟ he says. (P173)

  

Chapter Seven – Jean

She won‟t be so high and mighty today. (P176)

Kip has that set on his face that reminds me of his father, that wistful look. (P177)

Sometimes I dream Kip is Tom come back to life and I let him have it good and proper for dying on me like that. (P177)

„We all die alone.‟ (P177)

  

This is not how I imagined it to be. (P178)

  

Nothing will induce me to yell out for her like a fishwife. (P178)

She‟s looking next door across the lane. (P179)

„One day we won‟t even remember what he looked like, not without reminding.‟ (P179)

Then she looks me in the eye. „Ma. There‟s a baby.‟ (P180)

„Anyone who takes advantage of a girl deserves the shame of it.‟ (P182)

„I‟m having it. I don‟t care.‟ (P183)

  

It‟s Kip especially. She‟d do anything for him. (P185)

There‟s still hope for her, to have a husband and children the right way. (P185)

„Kip. Did you ever notice your sister stepping out with a boy?‟ (P186)

  

The shame that comes from behaving in ways you oughtn‟t. (P187)

She does what she‟s told for a change, doesn‟t ask any questions. (P187)

  

If so Connie has a chance of being a madam, for the rest of her life and the lives of her daughters and her daughters‟ daughters. (P189)

„And it‟s twenty-five pounds these days... War-time expenses.‟ (P191)

It takes all my strength to ger her on her feet. (P192)

„Ma,‟ she says, as I lay her down. „It‟s all I have of him.‟ (P192)

I‟d like to tell her there‟s nothing to be worried about. (P192)

If you‟re scared of this little thing, how would you ever have had a baby?‟ (P193)

On the street, Connie‟s no help at all but somehow she‟s not as heavy as this morning. (P197)

  

I move the dress and I see the thin spreading tide of blood as it seeps down between her legs. (P198)

„I was going to have it,‟ she says, clear as a bell. (P199)

  

„I decided. I wrote to him. He was going to come back to me and I‟d be here and the baby‟d be here and we‟d both be waiting.‟ (P199)

  

Chapter Eight – Alec

Yet here I am, Away from home in a world of strangers. Alone. Forgotten. (P201)

  

Charlotte was all don’t you dare walk out on me Alec don’t you dare. She is ruining my life. (P202)

  

This waiting for my life to start, it‟s driving me mental. (P203)

  

„This is so unfair. I would never get way with that. It‟s just because you‟re a boy.‟ (P204)

  

I shall stay here forever, waiting for your command, at your beck and call my queen.’ (P205)

  

The ways we are all the same, the ways we are different. (P205)

  

Unlike her, the quintessential woman afraid of commitment. Ipso facto, two children, no boyfriend. (P206)

  

„Hormones, girls, school, friends, pressure. It‟s a right pain in the arse.‟ (P209)

  

Grandpa is nearly here. I‟m not cutting off my nose despite my face. (P209)

  
  

... how he [Frank] gave it [the house] to Charlotte and Stanzi... (P210)

... because that was when he married that beautiful girl sitting there. Annabel Crouch. (P211)

„You‟ve always been the lucky one, Kip.‟ (P211)

  

„And it means everything to me to have my brother here, and our two beautiful girls, and our two wonderful grandchildren.‟ (P211)

  

„It‟s a fine old coin, isn‟t it Stanzi? Let me have a last look.‟ (P212)

  

... but inside, a brown envelope, is a photograph. (P215)

  

„Don‟t Kip. Not right to speak ill of the dead,‟ says Uncle Frank. (P216)

  

We aimed for smaller things: the health of our family, being warm, being safe. (P216)

  

„People disappear... Every time you see someone, you never know if you‟re seeing them for the last time.‟ (P218)

  

„Alec. He‟s old. What if he dies tonight? What if this was the last time you ever saw him and you had a chance to do something kind for someone who‟s done so much for you?‟ (P220)

  

„Westaway... For once in your life, do not be a pussy.‟ (P223)

  

The stuff he‟s talking about, though, the people-disappearing-never-to-be-seen-again stuff? That only happened back in the olden days. War and shit. (P227)

  

Then all at once it hits me: my mother is smaller than me. (P228)

  

„I thought about what would happen if I ever lost you.‟ (P229)

  

It means nothing that these people have vanished into thin air and will never be seen again. (P230)

  

Chapter Nine – Connie

This time when I open the front door I feel his eyes on me. (P232)

„I‟m not sure. I feel like part of me is asleep and part is awake. Does it matter?‟ (P233)

Jack Husting is not the kind of man who would ever make a fool of himself. (P233)

  

„It‟s you I think about... Every night when I can‟t sleep.‟ (P236)

  

„Just let me kiss you, Connie. I‟d die a happy man.‟ (P237)

This feeling is impossible, astounding. No other living soul has ever felt this way. (P239)

  

„I‟m not asking you to wait... Do you hear me? I‟m not asking you.‟ (P239)

„I‟ve got nothing to offer you.‟ (P240)

„I know... Just come back. (P240)

  

Not one scrap of me is the same yet they notice nothing different at all. (P241)

  

I want to run to Jack, hold him tight, beg him not to go. (P242)

Any moment now Jack‟ll be gone. (P243)

I‟m hoisted in the air like a small child, sitting on the shoulder of some stranger. (P243)

Everything that can be said‟s already said. (P244)

I don‟t stop looking until the train is gone. (P244)

What happens if I forget that a kiss can last forever? (P244)

„I didn‟t touch a thing.‟ (P244)

  

The secret to happiness is to be grateful. (P244)

  

I have my mother and Francis, and I have Kip, my darling Kip. (P245)

  

Whatever happens, I will keep this night stored away like the linen in my glory box. (P245)

  

I can hardly believe my good fortune. Everything will be all right. (P245)
