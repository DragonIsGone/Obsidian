### Programming and scripting languages
**1 What is the diﬀerence between a high-level programming language and a low-level**
**programming language?**
Low level programing languages such as "sudocode" high level code is more direct interactions with core systems of the computer such as kernel level / bios level
### Software development tools
**2 What are the essential tools used to develop software?**
Code editor, brief, IPO charts, Flowcharts
**3 Provide an example of source code in a programming language of your choice.**
*Link to UNO.py*
**4 What is the diﬀerence between a platform and an operating system?**
A os is only software i.e. windows
A platform is a relationship between software and some form of hardware i.e. MAC
**5 Why would a programmer choose to use an IDE?**
integrated development environments allow overview of code and easier identification of errors
### Emerging trends in programming and AI
**6 Explain the concept of low-code development platforms. How do they streamline the development process and who can beneﬁt from using them?**
Low code development allows more direct interaction with the client as they can more easily understand what the code is intended to do, this also goes for IPO charts and flowcahrts

**7 Discuss the importance of readability and maintainability in programming. How do modern programming languages and tools contribute to these aspects?**
readability and maintainability allows multiple people to work on a protect and easier matinence when the software is being used by the client allowing for higher uptimes. Many modern languages and IDEs have code snippets and comment tools to allow quicker and more seamless coding and coperation with remote repositories such as github

**8 Provide an example of a low-code development platform and an AI-based code generator.**
**Explain how each of these tools can be used to enhance the eﬃciency and quality of software**
**development.**
low code development allows a more simplistic view while AI-bassed generation means less simple lodgic errors can be made by the programmer
### Determining scope
**9 Deﬁne scope.**
scope is what the client is looking for the software to do (the primary function/features)
**10 What is scope creep?**
when new ideas are constantly added to make the software better and better at the cost of things like usability, readability and maintenance difficulty
### Functional and non-functional requirements
**11 What is the diﬀerence between a functional requirement and a non-functional requirement?** 
functional requierments are requierments to due with the critical operation of the software while non-functional relate to how the code may interact with the client i.e. how easy is it to train someone
**12 Categorise the following as functional or non-functional requirements. If the requirement is**
**non-functional, provide its type.**

**a Customer data should be saved to a ﬁle.** - functional
**b Users should only need an hour to be trained fully on the system.** - non-functional: usability
**c Uptime should be 95 per cent during summer months.** - non-functional: reliability
**d The system should reject invalid dates, such as 30 February.** - functional
**e Jobs should be able to be loaded into a timetable.** - functional
**f The system should stay running, with fewer than ﬁve hours per month spent maintaining**
**the system.** - non-function: maintinability
**g All orders should be printed in a report at the end of a work day.** - functional
