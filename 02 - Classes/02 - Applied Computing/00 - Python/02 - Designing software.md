## Functional and non-functional requirements
### Functional requirements - What the app must do
>Functional requirements are inputs that are critical to code execution
- functional requirements are related to what the solution does
- including:
	- calculations
	- data processing
	- opening, reading and writing files
	- data manipulation
- The "blueprint" to an app/program
#### Example:
- Save customer data
- calculate discount value
- set alarms at time
- jobs into timetable
### Non-functional requirements - How the app should perform
- things client would like but doesn't effect what the solution does
- Categorised in terms of:
	- reliability
	- usability
	- portability
	- robustness/maintainability
- determining non function calls for talks with client
- *example*: ask client if software needs to work on other operating systems 
- *example*: ask client level of technical experience of the end user

- Protecting user data/security relates to system operation making it a non-functional requirement
#### Usability
- usability refer to ease of use/learning curve
- *efficiency* and *effectiveness*
##### Examples
- clarity of UI elements
- intuitiveness of system
- success of usability measured in user satisfaction
>"users should be able to use all basic functions after one hour of training

#### Reliability
- Reliability is akin to uptime
- how long the software functions without maintenance
- *Uptime* and *fit for purpose*
##### Examples
- Software needs a 99.9% uptime over any 12 month period
>"ability to add a new customer should be available to staff members during working hours on weekdays"

#### Portability
- how easy it is to reintsall
- ease of transfer between similar architecture machines
- use of same software on different OS
##### Examples
- Separating UI elements from rest of code using comments -> ease of X-fer from mobile to PC
> "portability is increasingly important as mobile computing becomes the norm; users often expect that applications will work on mobile tech as well as on desktop"

#### Robustness
- how well software tolerates errors
- error handelling
- QA testing
- should perform correctly within every 
- ==Measured in number of fails, crashes and errors==
##### Examples
- software should not crash appon simple errors
>"a software solution responds to errors that occur when the software is being used;"

#### Maintainability
- how easy software is to look at 
- ease of error fixing/optimising/updating
- ease of installation
- measured in no. of hours dev/admin puts in to diagnose and update
##### Examples
- well written comments - [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex5eGnU1ZEY)
>"Fewer than 10 hours should be spent per quater on maintaining the system

## Constraints
### Economic constraints
- Time and cost of development
- how much it costs
- Deadlines set by client
- shorter timelines can constrain features/operational
#### Examples
- Budget constraints means people/hardware/software cannot be purchased
- time constraints leads to less feature packing
>"A lack of either time or money may result in re-evaluation of the user's requirements to a re-evaluation of how the requirements can be achieved

### Technical constraints
- The quality/power of hardware available
- akin to the development of the gaming industry as more powerful hardware
- smartphone users may not have enough computing power compared to desktop
#### Examples
- highspeed network is needed for animated data visualisation
>"constraints related to the hardware and software available for the project"

### Non-technical constraints

### Legal Constraints
