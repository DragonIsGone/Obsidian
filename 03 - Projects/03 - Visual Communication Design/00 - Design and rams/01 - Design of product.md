## Review
The Johnson Johnson garlic crusher is an unique design towards a garlic crusher, the crusher uses a rolling design to crush the garlic into mince as supposed to a paste , this innovative design means that the garlic mince can more easily flavour within the dish you are creating. The crusher also contains a simple intuitive design, one simple curved piece of metal with a grid of holes along the bottom side to pass the crushed garlic through, the design is minimal and is very robust and reliable. The object uses a very honest design in accordance to Dieter Rams' principles where when viewing the crusher in a store you know exactly what you get, nothing is hidden or pops out unexpectedly. The design of the garlic crusher also is in accordance with the idea of designs being useful as every part of it serves a purpose for the function of the crusher.![[Garlic Crusher 1 of 2.jpg]]

The Johnson Johnson garlic crusher, while it does follow many of dieter ram's design principles the overall effectiveness of the design has some question choices that shows some issues with how the crusher functions. The crusher's thickness means that the crushed garlic mince gets stuck in-between the holes of the crusher making it so you need to get a fork to remove the tiny bits of garlic between the holes of the mesh, this is deceptive compared to Johnsons Johnsons' promotional video for it shows the garlic flawlessly being cut and pushed out into the tub to be poured into the dish. The minimalist design of the crusher means that it is relatively easy to clean as there are no nooks or crannies that are difficult to reach into which is follow dieters principle of "less is more" and the rolling design of the crusher means it is more useful to people who are unable to squeeze down on a regular crusher meaning it is more accessible to the elderly

Overall the Johnson Johnson Garlic is an attempt at a innovative simplistic design aspiring to Dieter ram's 10 design principles while it succeeds in implementing some of the thoughts behind the principles it fails in the main aspect of the design being functional and easy to use. As the design has difficulty its main purpose it can be ascertained that this is a bad design for a garlic crusher.](<The Johnson Johnson garlic crusher is a unique design for a garlic crusher.

Overall, the Johnson Johnson Garlic is an attempt at an innovative, simplistic design aspiring to Dieter Rams' 10 design principles. While it succeeds in implementing some of the thoughts behind the principles, it fails in the main aspect of the design being functional and easy to use.
