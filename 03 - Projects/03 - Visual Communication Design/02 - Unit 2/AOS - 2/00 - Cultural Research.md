The hawthorn 2025 Sir Doug Nicholls Indigenous Round Jersey. This special round was created in 2005 and dubbed as the "Indigenous Round" and was later renamed to the Sir Doug Nicholls Round in 2015 in honour of his memory and contribution. Sir Doug Nicholls a Yorta Yorta man who was both an elite footballer and later a pastor, activist, and the first Aboriginal person to serve as a state governor in Australia being the Governor of South Australia, 1976–77. 

The design on the indigenous jersey is designed by proud Noongar and Yamatji man and Hawthorn's Indigenous Player Development Manager Jamie Bennell. He places several design iconographies on the jersey reflective of cultural norms of both indigenous Australians and the hawthorn football club. 

The nest faded into the background of the jersey shows the clubs idea of the club being a family home including the managers, the player, the members and the fans. The colouration of having it subtly blending with the background colours sells the idea to the viewer that while the idea of family may be subtle it is always there.

The hawk taking up the main symbolism of the jersey shows the club's strength and keen eye for their prey. This reflection on the club's mascot shows that the club has that same strength and keen vision, this aspect of the design would also emphasis this fact to their opponents.

The bottom crest underneath the eagle displays the players in the middle surrounded by the support of the team. This is through the coaches, staff and more, which is what brings the team together.

The 13 stars of the right side of the should displays the 13 premierships that the team had won, and the 5 circles on the left side display the evolution through the lands of their 5 home fields: Glenferrie, princess park, Waverly, utas and the MCG. These help to display the team's connection and history in tiny graphics which invoke senses of history and connection.

The colours used on the jerseys sells two purposes, it both identifies the players on the field and allows the senses of connection between the players and the fans with the same colours being used everywhere. 

The jersey invokes the fans to feel a sense of belonging, connection and community in the game and it tell stories through the fabric, not very loud but subtle.
