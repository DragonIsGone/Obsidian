### Reflection of prelife crisis
Do you ever sit back one day and reflect on your life so far? Do you feel like you never had time to achieve anything? Congratulations you have already entered a midlife crisis. You may think that its only adults who can do great things but that's not the case. If you have a moment in reflection you will realise that you have already achieved so much in your life and yet you can still achieve so much more. If you look at the world we have these days you may think that for all the doom and gloom there is nothing you can do to fix it, that is where I say you can. 

Reflection is a hell of a tool. From learning from your mistakes to reliving memories, good or bad, Someone's ability to reflect is one of the most critical skills for happiness. if you look back on your life and see guilt for all the things you have not done don't feel guilty about it, its never too late to make a name for yourself. You know KFC right? Colonel Sanders founded KFC at age 65 after multiple failures. The car at least some of you took to school? Henry Ford created the first mass production car, the 'Ford Model T', at age 45 and revolutionised the transport industry. These made names for themselves despite the fact they were considered 'old' by many people at the time, let you know that means its never too late to start something new, so start something new with your life and 

Although hang on some of you may think 'Those people are still older than me I am a kid no one listens to me, that's where I tell you that you are wrong yet again. Many famous people still started as teenagers and even children. At least 4 of you here should be familiar with Mozart, come on his symphonies is played up here every second week. Well he started to write his stunning music at age 5 and was performing royally at age 6 how is that for an early start? Ok you may think that is too early but Serena Williams won her first grand slam in 1999 at only age 17, that about what most of you are right now. You way reflect on these people and think that 'I will never amount to that they were crazy good' well, no one ever starts out great, it takes effort, you probably heard that saying that for the billionth time by now but its true. 

Now your probably reflecting on the gibberish I said up here and wondering 'how do I start this magical journey of improvement' well the best thing to do is try anything, doesn't have to be something special just throw anything at the wall. Learn something new, invent something, campaign for something you believe in. Small actions like Pat Quinn and Pete Frante's ice bucket challenge went from a small idea to a $220 million fundraiser for ALS. 

if you try things today maybe sometime in the future you will reflect on this day as you write your autobiography about your world changing life.

## Reflection
The speech I crafted "reflection on prefile crisis" was a speech intended to be read at a school assembly and was aimed towards individual action in the student body on how it isn't too early or too late to make a name for yourself. This purpose could also be conveyed to secondary audiences such as teachers and other guests present.

Using a speech in this situation is the most effective way I could connect with the target audience as having someone directly talk with more the hints of casual language used throughout the piece helped to lower the scale of the piece to the personal connection it was intended to have with the audience. The casual language was used in areas of hopefully slight humour such as "At least 4 of you here should be familiar with Mozart, come on his symphonies is played up here every second week.". These personal and casual language methods would mean that both the primary and secondary audiences' would remember the messaging of the speech after it was finished.

I intended the final part of the speech to emulate the values of the whole speech and to give the story of writing your autobiography to reinforce the point that the ideas presented in the speech could be the start of a great life.
