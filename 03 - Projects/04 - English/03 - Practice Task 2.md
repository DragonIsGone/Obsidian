# Bridges to fix broken societies

 Bridges have been used as an important metaphor for connection and friendship. The phrase "to build bridges" has been long been viewed as a positive action, to create a relationship between people, communities and more. Bridges can be useful for our communities too, constructing connections with people we might not get along with. This metaphorical idea stands opposite to people who "build barriers", construct walls to divide communities. Whether it is politicians opening diplomatic peace talks or Social justice leaders trying to gain a fairer world for all people who brought meaningful change were hailed at their skill of creating connections to people who may not have been respected.

While a bridge can be used to create a crossing to unite two sides of a river some people would seek to build a barrier instead. Many country leaders who tried to construct barriers to isolate their countries were found to be on a bad side of history. supposed leaders such as Adolf Hitler who lead great divide during Nazi Germany and Donald Trump leading great political within the United States of America. These campaigns have created barriers in many communities throughout their reign. Such barriers were detrimental to collaboration between these communities and ultimately ended in people's lives being destroyed. A bridge can let people cross a river without impacting the environment, attempting to build a barrier to stop the river . The broken idea of building a barrier to divide people is a foolish attempt to control people. 

Many of the people who changed the world for the better did so by building bridges to those who were seen as "unfriendly" this can be seen by the actions taken to connect with these people. Significant political figures such as John F Kennedy sought to strengthen diplomatic talks with the soviet union during the treacherous times of the cold war this helped benefit society by removing the risk of nuclear war. Many social movements seek to build bridges that connect people who were disadvantaged in broken societies these include movements like Martin Luther King Jr's racial equality movements during the civil rights era. By making these connections these extraordinary people were able to bring change to benefit those who were looked down upon. Building bridges can be incredibly useful in fixing broken societies. Societies that are unjust and broken can be repaired by people who are willing to build bridges to connect all parts of the community.

Building a connection between people in our community can help us in our lives every day throughout history we have seen many great leaders connect different sides with bridges. This connection is a key way to fix a broken society, While people who foolishly try to build barriers that ultimately is their legacy through collaboration and joining together anything can be made new. Many great politicians and social movements fixed the world as it was breaking apart.
Bridges are one of the most effective methods to connect people, and whether it be a physical bridge or a metaphorical connection between two distinct and opposed communities these connections will help foster greatness in any society.

### Reflective commentary

The essay I constructed "Bridges to fix broken societies" was made to convey the argument about how societal division is not conducive to success and how we should move towards making connection.

I chose an essay form for my piece as it was an effective method of conveying opinion in a piece that is being presented to a wide range of people. I believed that this essay would be published as a piece in a school newspaper in regards to leadership to be viewed by the school. The wide range of people I was looking to convey the idea to is people who aspire to be leaders in the future as such the essay would be a tool to show examples out of our history.

I wrote the style to show examples of barriers being used to create divide in societies causing them to break and examples of when bridges were constructed in a metaphorical sense to create senses of community. My essay kept to a professional language to convey it legitimacy on the topic to help convey its message more clearly to the target audience. The language was designed to very clearly paint the two different scenarios and relate it back to the title with metaphors.

The final paragraph was meant to summarize the essay, as usual, but to also reconvey a lot of the points to make sure the key messages of building connections between people to help create a better world for everyone to live in.
